## **Project Overview**

**Project Title:** AI Fine-Tuning — BERT Fine-Tune (Udemy Course Project)  
**Purpose:** Fine-tuned a pretrained BERT model on a downstream NLP task to demonstrate practical skills in transfer learning, model evaluation, and experiment tracking. This project was completed as part of the AI Fine-Tuning course on **Udemy** and is designed to showcase end-to-end fine-tuning workflows for potential employers.

**Objective**  
Show how to take a pretrained transformer (BERT), adapt it to a supervised task (classification / sequence labeling / regression as applicable), and produce reproducible results, clear evaluation, and simple inference code that can be re-used or extended in production.



## **Why this project matters to employers**

Yes — this kind of project can definitely serve as a strong portfolio piece **if** it clearly demonstrates:
- practical machine learning skills (fine-tuning pretrained models),
- software engineering hygiene (reproducible code, requirements, scripts),
- experiment tracking & evaluation (metrics, confusion matrices, loss curves),
- understanding of deployment constraints (model size, latency, inference code),
- clear documentation so non-technical reviewers and hiring managers can understand the impact.

Employers value projects that are well-documented, reproducible, and show measurable impact (improved accuracy, business-relevant metric, or a working demo). See the **Suggested improvements** section below for ways to make this project stand out even more.

## **Key Components & Features**

- **Model:** Pretrained BERT (e.g., `bert-base-uncased`) fine-tuned for a target task.
- **Task Types (adaptable):** Text classification (binary / multi-class), sentiment analysis, intent detection, or sequence labeling.
- **Data preparation:** tokenization (WordPiece), padding/truncation, train/val/test split, label encoding.
- **Training loop:** PyTorch (or Hugging Face `transformers`) training loop with AdamW, learning rate scheduler, gradient clipping, checkpointing.
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and training/validation loss curves.
- **Inference:** Lightweight inference script/notebook to run predictions on new examples.
- **Reproducibility:** fixed seeds, required packages (`requirements.txt`), and notebook documenting hyperparameters and results.
- **Artifacts:** saved model checkpoints, training logs, evaluation reports, and a short demo notebook.

## **How to run (quickstart)**

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<YourUsername>/bert-finetune-project.git
cd bert-finetune-project
```

2. **Create a virtual environment & install requirements**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Prepare data**
- Place your dataset files in `data/` (example: `data/train.csv`, `data/val.csv`, `data/test.csv`).  
- Expected columns (example): `text`, `label`.  
- Update the path/column names in `src/data_loader.py` or the notebook.

4. **Train (example using train.py)**
```bash
python src/train.py \
  --model_name_or_path bert-base-uncased \
  --train_file data/train.csv \
  --valid_file data/val.csv \
  --output_dir models/checkpoints/exp1 \
  --epochs 3 \
  --batch_size 16 \
  --lr 2e-5
```

5. **Evaluate**
```bash
python src/eval.py --model_dir models/checkpoints/exp1 --test_file data/test.csv
```

6. **Predict / Inference**
```bash
python src/predict.py --model_dir models/checkpoints/exp1 --input "This is an example sentence"
```

## **What employers look for — how to strengthen this project**

To make this project truly stand out in a portfolio, consider adding the following:

1. **Clear README (this file)** — explain objective, data, results, and how to reproduce.
2. **Data Dictionary** — describe dataset columns, class balance, and any preprocessing decisions.
3. **Model Card** — short document with model purpose, metrics, limitations, and ethical considerations.
4. **Reproducibility:**  
   - `requirements.txt` (or `environment.yml`)  
   - training hyperparameters in a single config (YAML/JSON)  
   - seed control and exact hardware notes (GPU type, RAM)
5. **Experiment logs** — use MLflow / Weights & Biases for logged runs and visualized metrics.
6. **Lightweight demo** — simple Streamlit/Flask app or Colab notebook for inference so recruiters can try it quickly without installing.
7. **Deployment notes** — explain how to serve model (TorchScript, ONNX, or Hugging Face Inference API), estimated latency, and memory footprint.
8. **Ablation / Error analysis** — short section showing common failure cases and potential fixes.
9. **License & Ethics** — mention data licensing and privacy considerations.
10. **Short video** — 1–2 minute walk-through of results and demo; recruiters often appreciate quick demos.

## **Suggested Next Steps (optional enhancements)**

- Add a `MODEL_CARD.md` and `DATA_DICTIONARY.md`.
- Add unit-tests for preprocessing functions and a small integration test for the `predict.py` script.
- Provide a pre-built Dockerfile for reproducible runtime and easy demo deploys.
- Add CI (GitHub Actions) to run linting and small smoke tests on the codebase.

## **Final note — short answer to your general question**

**Can this kind of project help you get employed?**  
**Yes.** If the project is well-documented, reproducible, and demonstrates measurable results (evaluation metrics, training stability, inference examples), it shows employers you can: design experiments, work with modern NLP models, write reproducible code, and communicate technical outcomes. Boost its impact by including a short demo, model card, and clear README (like this), and you’ll significantly increase its value as a portfolio piece.

If you'd like, I can also:
1. Generate `MODEL_CARD.md` and `DATA_DICTIONARY.md` templates based on your notebook.  
2. Create a small Streamlit demo script for in-repo inference.  
3. Replace the screenshot placeholder with an actual image if you upload one now.
